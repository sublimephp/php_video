    "storyline": "Pacarrete (Marcélia Cartaxo) is a retired dance teacher, who lives with her sister Chiquinha (Zezita Matos) in Russas, in the interior of Ceará, with Maria (Soia Lira) as a domestic servant. Strict and surly, she lives cleaning the sidewalk and fighting with whoever passes her. His big dream is to star in a ballet for the local population during the big party in the city, which is about to happen. To this end, she orders a new ballet outfit to be made while trying to convince the city hall of her show. However, the general population's lack of interest in such shows soon becomes a major opponent."
